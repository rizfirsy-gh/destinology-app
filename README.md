# Destinology App

## Project Overview

Indonesia has a lot of potential with its tourism sector. There's a lot improvement that can be done and we come up with an app that can enhance user experience before and during travel. We conclude that itinerary planners that give recommendations based on user preferences are a suitable solution. During the travel, sometimes tourist stumble upon a landmark that peek their interest. It's hard to know what that landmark just by searching its physical features. To solve this problem, our app has a feature of landmark recognition and also gives a couple of fun fact about the recognized landmark.

## Project Scope

### Machine Learning [(Repository)](https://github.com/diga-tech/Destinology_ML)

- Utilizes TensorFlow for giving personalized recommendations on itinerary planners.
- Employs machine learning models for landmark detection to enhance the tourist experience.

### Cloud Computing [(Repository)](https://github.com/dhiyarisalah/destinology)
- Implements a user registration and login system using APIs for authentication.
- Stores and manages assets in Google Cloud Storage for efficient data handling.
- Deploys machine learning models to the cloud for scalability and accessibility.

### Mobile Development

- Designs & develops a user-friendly UI design for the Android application.
- Implements the Android application using Kotlin, integrating all the features seamlessly.
- Integrate with Machine Learning and CLoud Computing sides.
- Ensures a smooth and intuitive user experience throughout the app.
